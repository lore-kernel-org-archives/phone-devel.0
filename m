Hi Jonathan!

I fixed most things, some elaboration inline:

Yeah I am experimenting to find a good way. Maybe I will try to extract
u64 and chop out the bits from there to make it clearer.

I think a lot of clock drivers have this problem already.

Please clarify what you want the end result to look like, I don't
quite get it... Looking a the latest committed drivers in linux-next
didn't give a clue either.

It's pretty safe as we definately account for all magnetometers
of the naming scheme YAS53x. The YAS534 would be in another
subsystem (proximity, I guess) so the path to the file gives the
right info: this covers all magnetometers named yas53x, goes
for both the bindings and the driver I think?

OK I try to detail a bit.

Since this segment easily fits in a u64 I thought about
extracing a u64 and then use FIELD_GET on that.

I already tried that but it looks even worse :/

I will try to put them into a bigger word instead.

It sadly doesn't look any better if I operate on u8 chars. :/
I'll try to think of something.

Yeah oddly it turns it into just "YAS530":

skomer:/home/linus# lsiio
Device 003: bma222
Device 001: current-sense-amplifier
Device 004: gp2ap002
Device 002: mpu3050
Device 000: ab8500-gpadc
Device 005: YAS530
Trigger 000: mpu3050-dev2

But it doesn't look nice, I will rename it lowercase.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
