Yeah that sounds like a solution for now.

But for other devices I hope something can be figured out so that these
dummy panels can go into upstream dts. Otherwise the functionality added
in the simplefb driver is kinda useless for pure upstream if noone's
allowed to have incomplete bindings for providing the panel dimensions.

Yes, later ;)
