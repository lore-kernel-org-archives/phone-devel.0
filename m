It may even be depending on specimen. I saw that the vendor driver
does contain some debouncing code.

Yeah probably, if they are electrically very similar.

I usually google ... try to find things like powerpoints with roadmaps
from the vendor and things like that. Best thing is if they answer
to mail but I don't know if Zinitix are even around anymore.

Hm yeah I guess refer to the (messy) vendor driver for hints.
