As these parameters are part of the dts downstream, I assume they differ
per board or actual LRA used.

But I also found other downstream dts examples on github (e.g.
awinic,aw8697_haptic) and they also seemed to use the same values for
these couple of registers (r_spare, tset and bstdbg). Maybe I can gather
more info but it's unlikely I'll be able to get a concrete answer..
