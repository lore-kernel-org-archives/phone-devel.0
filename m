Same on any Raspberry Pi camera module. The VCM is powered by the same
enable lines as the Sensor there I think which has made things
interesting in handling VCMs for those devices.

This is an issue though, as libcamera opens the device nodes and holds
the file descriptor when it has a camera. This means that even if the
camera isn't streaming, the VCM is powered on and causes power
consumption on mobile devices which people then attribute to pipewire.

Do you foresee use cases where a linked VCM shouldn't be  powered while
a camera is streaming? That effectively means the lens position seen by
the camera is 'arbitrary' / undefined ?

Cc Dave too as he's looked at similar things in the past.
