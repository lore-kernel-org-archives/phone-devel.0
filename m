Yes, this has been an issue in DT for a long time. :-( I'm not sure if this
approach could extend into a solution for that though.

A practical fix for that could be to set the current to 0 when streaming is
off.

It's neither, in that case the lens will be just in the resting position
which is typically close to infinite.
