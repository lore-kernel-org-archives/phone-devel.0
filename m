Well, okay... it's just that I didn't want reviewers to lose time with
something that had to be fixed, as it wasn't working anymore on the
newest RC, due to a commit that was (rightfully!) blocking the abuse of
the OPP API.

I know that it may be not practical to send a new version while a
discussion is in progress, but this looked like being a critical fix
for the driver that I'm sending.

In any case, this time it is a "final" version and will not get any more
changes unless requested by reviewers/maintainers.
