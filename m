I'm not convinced that there is a clear expectation here, any change
will doubtless upset some other user (for example someone using a system
derived from a reference board that happens to work with it's device
tree, or something where the firmware puts discovered information into
DMI).  Really you're just not supposed to combine DMI and DT based
discovery methods, having a system shipping both is just going to lead
to confusion and there's no way we can possibly get it right.  You have
decided that for your systems the DMI information is bad and you want to
override it but that doesn't mean that the next person won't make the
opposite choice.  Any decision here should be policy based in userspace
based on the full system information.

Please don't send content free pings and please allow a reasonable time
for review.  People get busy, go on holiday, attend conferences and so=20
on so unless there is some reason for urgency (like critical bug fixes)
please allow at least a couple of weeks for review.  If there have been
review comments then people may be waiting for those to be addressed.

Sending content free pings adds to the mail volume (if they are seen at
all) which is often the problem and since they can't be reviewed
directly if something has gone wrong you'll have to resend the patches
anyway, so sending again is generally a better approach though there are
some other maintainers who like them - if in doubt look at how patches
for the subsystem are normally handled.
