So... since torvalds/master my sm6350 patch is merged through Rob's
tree, but there was also a sm8150 patch applied through Linus Walleij's
tree. This means (as far as I understand) that neither can really
properly apply this (rebased) patch as one tree will have missed the
other commit.

Does it make sense to send a v3 rebased on linux-next now, or wait until
this has settled down in torvalds's tree?

Luca
