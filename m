Essential in what way? What will break if such compatible is not there?
We have lived without it for many years and will continue live happily
without it for years to come.

We keep having this conversation each time there is self-describing
protocol that does not require knowledge of a specific part number:
i2c-hid, rmi4, spi-hid coming over soon.

We might need a device-specific compatible if we need to implement
particular power on sequence/adjust timings, and that's when it starts
making sense to introduce one.

Different from what?

$ git grep syna,rmi4 -- arch/ | wc -l
43

Do you have plans to list each and every chip currently covered by
syna,rmi4* ?

Well, the devil is in the details. And that is what I am trying to

But the core issue that David is trying to solve is the fact that these
headsets do not work well with aftermarket parts with the upstream
kernels. It is not a theoretical problem for him, it is something that
he's been trying to solve for a while.

However from my POV I need to make sure the changes to the driver do not
affect or limit well-behaved devices implementing RMI4 protocol
properly.

Well, as I mentioned above my understanding is that David really wants
to solve the issue with after market parts not working properly.

So is the suggestion to check if the board matches "oneplus,enchilada",
"oneplus,fajitas" with of_machine_compatible_match()?

David?
