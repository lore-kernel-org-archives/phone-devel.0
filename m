Will do for v2 then!

Right. If external components are strictly necessary, physically, they're
still external components and not inside of the SoC, and anything external
*may* change depending on the (hardware) implementation.

Anyway - I was wondering if splitting this change in two commits would be
better to let people understand what's going on... probably it would, as
that would clearly show both the addition of the 32K/26M clocks and the
subsequent removal of the other two: I would at this point do that, what
do you think?

Angelo
