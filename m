If you need to touch the buffers using the CPU then you are either
stuck with uncached memory or you need to implement bracketed access to
do the necessary cache maintenance. Be aware that completely flushing
the cache is not really an option, as that would impact other
workloads, so you have to flush the cache by walking the virtual
address space of the buffer, which may take a significant amount of CPU
time.

However, if you are only going to use the buffer with the GPU I see no
reason to touch it from the CPU side. Why would you even need to copy
the content? After all dma-bufs are meant to enable zero-copy between
DMA capable accelerators. You can simply import the V4L2 buffer into a
GL texture using EGL_EXT_image_dma_buf_import. Using this path you
don't need to bother with the cache at all, as the GPU will directly
read the video buffers from RAM.

Regards,
Lucas
