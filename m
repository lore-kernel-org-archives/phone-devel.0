"power_up", "start", *and* "enable".. this naming is a mess now.

Would be nicer to make the *names* more descriptive of what's actually 
being turned on/off.

Would make more sense to stick the intermediate state in the, well, 
middle. And rename the states to something that makes sense like { OFF, 
WAITING_FOR_BIT_CLOCK, RUNNING } instead of making everything a comment 
like the slop machine left it.

It does work here, anyhow, so
